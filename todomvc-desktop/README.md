# TodoMVC as Desktop app with Github Electron

Make sure you have run `npm install` in the **parent directory**.

Run `npm run build` to compile the code to JS
and `npm run start` to launch the desktop app.

Use `npm run build-debug` to start Fable in
watch mode (F# source files will be recompiled
on save) and make Electron refresh the app window
automatically. Run `npm run start` in a different
terminal window.
