Make sure you have run `npm install` in the **parent directory**.

Run `npm run build` to compile the code to JS
and `npm run start` to fire up a local server
and start playing the game.

Run `npm run build-debug` to start Fable in
watch mode (F# source files will be recompiled
on save). In this case, run `npm run start` in
a different terminal window and refresh the
browser manually to see the changes.
