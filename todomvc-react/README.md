# TodoMVC with React and Redux

Make sure you have run `npm install` in the **parent directory**.

Run `npm run build` to compile the code to JS
and `npm run start` to to fire up a local server
and open the web app in a browser.

Use `npm run build-debug` to start Fable in
watch mode (F# source files will be recompiled
on save).
