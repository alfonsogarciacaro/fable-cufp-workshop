# TodoMVC with React and Redux

Make sure you have run `npm install` in the **parent directory**.

Run `npm run build` to compile the code to JS
and `npm run start` to to fire up a local server
and open the web app in a browser.

Use `npm run build-debug` to start Fable in
watch mode (F# source files will be recompiled
on save). Then you can run `npm run start-debug`
in a different terminal window to launch a
**Webpack Dev Server** that will automatically
update React components without refreshing the page
(open `localhost:8080` in your browser to see the app).
